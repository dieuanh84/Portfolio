A comprehensive view of my projects

Hi, I'm Olivia Nguyen, an aspiring data analyst with a passion for the AI and finance domain. I'm currently majoring in Business Analytics and expecting to get my Bachelor in Business Administration degree in June 2025.

As someone who switched path at the end of her sophomore year, I had many moments of doubt where I felt left behind. However, the excitement when I solve a logical problem gives me the dopamine unmatched by balancing a total assets and total liabilities & equity. Therefore, I decided to stick with Business Analytics and found my enthusiasm for data only being deepened as I get more into the field. Now, I'm determined to get into the Data Science field to explain the power and beauty of numbers to a wider audience.

I'm focusing on machine learning models for data analysis, but also continuously enhancing my background knowledge in finance and AI as well as other technical skills like visualization, communication, coding, data engineering, and so on. I'm eager to learn and to practice my skills in real life problems, thus keeping my options open and always willing to take on new challenges.
